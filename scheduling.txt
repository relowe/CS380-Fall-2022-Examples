- Multiplexing the CPU across several processes.

1.) Select a process.
2.) Switch to the process.
3.) After some time, go back to step 1.


Scheduling Strategies - How do we select the process?

    How do we select a runnable process?
       - Complete smaller processes first.
       - Make sure that every process gets some computer time.
       - Maximize Throughput (complete as much as possible)
       - Keep the CPU busy
       - Keep the system responsive

    Schemes for selecting processes.
        - Round Robin Scheduling
          Cycle through each runnable process in turn.
          Pros: Really easy to implement and understand.
                Very fair.
          Cons: Cannot prioritize processes.
                System will "feel" laggy.

        - Priority Queue
          Assigns a priority number to each process.
          Sorts runnable processes by priority.
          Performs round-robin scheduling on the sorted list.
          Pros: Easy to implement to understand (sort of)
                We can prioritize.
          Cons: Possible to starve a process.
